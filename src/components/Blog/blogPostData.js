        "text": "To be successful in today\u2019s job market, it pays to put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. After all, their perception of your CV could result in a job interview or another rejection. Having a basic understanding of how recruiters review CVs and what they look for will give you an advantage when it comes to writing one effectively. Before writing your CV, consider the following aspects of recruiters\u2019 mindset.\n<h2>Make the hiring manager want to open your CV<\/h2>\nTo get your CV noticed, you must include a tailored cover note in every one of your applications. Whether you are applying via a job website or direct email, write a friendly and professional paragraph to introduce yourself, build rapport, and explain why your CV is worth reading.\n<h2>Make your CV easy to skim-read<\/h2>\nRecruiters are pushed for time, so they will usually spend a few seconds skimming your CV for must-have terms before they decide to commit to reading it fully.  Make your CV extremely easy to read with a clean, simple font, clearly divided sections and short, sharp points.\nNever make readers wade through large paragraphs of text. You should also research your target roles thoroughly to identify your most sought-after skills and ensure they are made prominent at the top of your CV. Providing a pleasant reading experience and reflecting the recruiter\u2019s needs in your CV will hold their attention and create a perfect first impression.\n<h2>Buff up your current or most recent role<\/h2>\nOnce recruiters have had a quick scan of your CV, they will look at your current or most recent role. This role is easily the best way to measure your current capabilities, so recruiters will spend lots of time reviewing this part of your CV. Spend plenty of time writing this role description and think about the questions that recruiters will want to know when reading it:\n<ul>\n<li>Where do you sit within the organisation?<\/li>\n<li>Do you manage a team?<\/li>\n<li>How do you contribute to the company?<\/li>\n<li>What results did you achieve for your employer or clients?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nStructure the role with an introductory sentence to build context, then bullet point your responsibilities, and round the role off with some impressive \n<h2>Weed out mistakes<\/h2>\nEssentially, recruiters just want to find the candidate who matches their client\u2019s brief as closely as possible \u2013 it\u2019s that simple. Ultimately, if you can show them that you have the skills and experience they are looking for, then you stand a good chance of being selected. If you also adopt clarity in the formatting of your CV to consider recruiter\u2019s time constraints and workloads, you will see plenty of interview requests coming your way.\n<br><br><br>\n<span>Andrew Fennell is founder of CV writing service<a href=\"https://standout-cv.com\" target=\"_blank\"> StandOut CV <\/a> and author of <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/pages/how-to-write-a-cv\" target=\"_blank\">How to write a CV<\/a> \u2013 the ultimate guide.<\/span>\n<br><br><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/oct/03/five-ways-to-get-your-cv-noticed-by-employers\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n"

        "text": "<P>Cover letters can be the first chance you get to stand out to your potential employer. What makes them so difficult to get right is that there\u2019s no clear-cut formula. But there are certainly a few pointers to help you along.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the sole point of a cover letter is to draw attention to your CV, which holds all of your relevant information, experience and skills. In just a couple of short paragraphs, you should be able to show competent language skills, that you\u2019d be suitable for the role in terms of your skills and experience, and that you have a genuine interest in the job.<\/p>\n<p>To get this right, a cover letter should be unique to the organisation and job you\u2019re applying to. \u201cIt must never feel like a one size fits all application letter that has been sent out to everyone,\u201d says Hannah Morton-Hedges from Momentum Careers Advice.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to show that you\u2019ve researched the company, so you\u2019re able to clearly show you\u2019re the right person to work there. \u201cWe love to see covering letters where applicants have made a real effort to connect with us, show that they understand a bit about us and therefore why we would be a particularly good match for each other,\u201d says Rachel Gowers, culture manager at customer ratings firm TruRating.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of what should actually go in the letter, the advice can vary, but essentially you should \u201cexplain why you have applied for this job, what appeals to you about the role and why you would love to work for this organisation\u201d, says Lisa LaRue, career and interview coach at CareerWorx. Highlight why you would be suitable for the job \u2013 but make sure you don\u2019t repeat the information on your CV.<\/p>\n<p>Jon Gregory, a job search, application and interview specialist, suggests that the best formula is to write an introduction that \u201cstates what job you are applying for and that you believe you\u2019re a good match based on the ad requirements for the following reasons...\u201d He suggests you should then include a three bullet point summary of why you are a great choice to interview: \u201cIt gets them to open your CV with enthusiasm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always best to address the letter to a named person \u2013 LinkedIn is usually a good place to search, or it\u2019s advisable to call the organisation and ask for the correct name. If not, you can use \u201cDear Sir/Madam\u201d (although this formality may not be suitable for more modern, startup companies).<\/p>\n<p>And if a job ad doesn\u2019t specifically ask for a cover letter, it\u2019s always worth writing an email in the shape of a cover letter anyway. \u201cA cover letter is simply a note to introduce yourself and ensure that your CV gets opened, so in this case you should write your cover note in the body of the email,\u201d says Fennell.<\/p>\n<p>A good cover letter should be able to make potential employers take an interest in you. But to show them why you\u2019d be the right person for job, you must first \u201cknow what is good about yourself. The key is to take stock of your unique selling points\u201d, says LaRue. \u201cYou need to really understand the value you bring to a potential employer to tell them why you\u2019re best for the job.\u201d<\/p>\n<br><br><br>\t\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/sep/25/how-to-write-cover-letter-perfect-pitch\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n"

        "text": "After investing time crafting your perfect CV, online applications may seem monotonous and time-consuming, but with many big employers favouring them, you need to learn how to use them effectively.\nTo impress recruiters, every online job application form should include seven key points:\n<h2>Suitability<\/h2>\nThis should come as no surprise, but it\u2019s easy to forget the goal and go into auto-pilot when filling out a lengthy application form. Simply going through the motions and answering questions will not get you the best results. Think of every question as an opportunity to sell yourself and prove you are the right choice. Find out the exact requirements for the role and try to match your skills in every answer.\n<h2>Experience<\/h2>\nWhen writing expansive answers, use real-life examples to show recruiters you have a proven record in your field. Use personal pronouns (I, me etc) when describing your actions; avoid collective terms such as \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour team\u201d. This will differentiate your contribution from that of your colleagues and show the value you could bring to the role.\n<h2>Skills<\/h2>\nYour CV will no doubt be packed with examples of your skills, so you need to transfer them to your application form. Provide solid examples of the skills you have developed and don\u2019t leave any important ones out. Once you\u2019ve completed your form, it\u2019s a good idea to scan the whole document and compare it with your CV to check for any missing skills. Focus on detailing hard skills specific to your industry rather than soft skills as these are what recruiters will be looking for.\n<h2>Knowledge<\/h2>\nKnowledge is power in the workplace, so you need to prove yours in your online applications. This could range from market or industry expertise, to IT systems or process knowledge. Use your answers to demonstrate how you apply your knowledge to the benefit of your employers, and include popular language and terminology.\n<h2>Results<\/h2>\nYou wouldn\u2019t send out your CV without examples of the results you have achieved and an application form should be no different. Try to round up every answer with tangible results to give recruiters an idea of the impact your work has had. Listing your actions and responsibilities is great, but it\u2019s worthless if you don\u2019t show how your actions benefited your previous employers. If you can link your work directly to important business metrics, such as saving costs or generating revenue, you will impress potential employers and receive more responses.\n<h2>Communication skills<\/h2>\nWritten communication skills are required in most roles, so it\u2019s important you convey them in your application. Don\u2019t simply state \u201cI have strong communication skills\u201d, as anybody could do that. Instead, use the form to demonstrate your written communication skills. Write well-structured sentences with a professional tone. This will give recruiters a good idea of how you would communicate with colleagues.\n<br><br><br>\n<span>Andrew Fennell is an experienced recruiter and the founder of CV writing service <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StandOut CV<\/a>.<\/span>\n<br><br><br>\t\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/aug/23/how-to-ace-online-job-application-forms\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n"

While not all career breaks might be so adventurous, taking time off from work can be a great way to recharge or reflect on a new career direction.<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t worry about employers frowning on a career break. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely acceptable to take time out and travel,\u201d says HR and resourcing specialist Lydia Fairman. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity and most employers will recognise that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Career breaks and sabbaticals can involve more than travel, too. \u201cSee if you can get involved in any volunteer opportunities, or make any trips that you feel you could put on your CV, even something like a bit of time teaching, such as Tefl,\u201d adds Fairman.<\/p>\n<p>Before your break, think about what you\u2019d like to achieve. \u201cAllow yourself to be honest about what you\u2019d love to spend this time doing and let that be the driver of your plans,\u201d advises Natasha Stanley, head coach and head of content at Careershifters.<\/p>\n<p>She also suggests planning your trip with someone. \u201cTaking a break can feel scary enough without trying to tackle the whole project on your own. Find some supportive friends or family to help you build confidence about your plans and find creative solutions to your concerns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jon Gregory, a job search, application and interview specialist, recommends thinking of your break as a project. \u201cBe clear about what you\u2019re aiming to achieve and proactively manage yourself throughout to make sure you achieve it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait until the day you return to start job hunting,\u201d says Andrew Fennell, director of StandOut CV. \u201cLanding a role can take time, so get some feelers out a few weeks before [you return].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So you\u2019ve explored China for three months or volunteered on home turf for half the year. How should you position your career break on paper? \u201cMake sure you cover the gap on your CV so it\u2019s addressed clearly,\u201d says Sarah Archer, a qualified career coach and founder of CareerTree. \u201cJust state that you were travelling, you don\u2019t need to justify it any more.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Upon return, Archer recommends networking and joining LinkedIn groups. \u201cAsk questions and begin to build relationships (the groups are great for this), and also provide advice in your own skills area. You will find opportunities arise, don\u2019t focus on the gap, but on what you will bring to the company or role.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t worry about taking time out of your career. Whether you\u2019re looking after an ill parent or you need to recharge your batteries for a few months, employers understand that career paths today aren\u2019t just one direct line. There are bends and curves, but as long as you explain these on your CV and highlight the skills you acquired, you\u2019ll most certainly win over potential employers.<\/p>\n<br><br><br>\t\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/aug/29/back-to-work-reviving-your-career-after-a-sabbatical\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n"

        "text": "<p>Writing your CV can be tough if you have no work experience. When even entry-level jobs ask for experienced candidates, it can leave you wondering if you will ever get that first step on the career ladder.<\/p>\n<p>Even the most senior professionals started with a blank CV and no experience, however, so it\u2019s certainly possible to create an impressive CV without having the advantage of work experience. By using a professional format that highlights your transferable skills and achievements, you can create a CV that will land you interviews for the jobs you want.<\/p>\n<h2>Start with some research<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re just leaving education and have never worked in a professional environment, it\u2019s unlikely that you will already know what employers look for in an ideal candidate. Get an advantage over competing applicants by researching your target employers and identifying what they value in an employee.<\/p>\n<p>Decide on the types of jobs you want to apply for, search through plenty of relevant job adverts and make a list of the requirements that regularly appear. These could be qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels or skills such as communication, organisation or languages. <\/p>\n<h2>Draw on non-work related experience<\/h2>\n<p>To compensate for your lack of direct work experience, it\u2019s important that you include plenty of detail in all other areas of your CV, to showcase the skills that you can offer an employer. The following key areas will give you plenty of scope to demonstrate your capabilities:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Education<\/strong>: As a school-leaver or recent graduate you should have plenty to write about your education. Use this section to showcase your talents by including plenty of detail around the grades you achieved, the topics you studied, other projects you completed and positions of responsibility you held. Writing about your educational experience comprehensively will allow you to demonstrate workplace skills such as organisation, planning, team work, motivation and meeting competing deadlines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interests and hobbies<\/strong>: Although you may think that your hobbies are irrelevant to your job search, they can often make a great addition to a CV. If you have any interests that are pertinent to your job or the role you are applying for (such as an IT candidate applicant who runs a personal website in their spare time) then it\u2019s definitely worth including them to show you skills and dedication in the field. Impressive achievements such as running marathons, organising fundraising events or leading sports teams can prove you have a pro-active attitude and ambitious nature.<\/p>\n<h2>Sell yourself with a CV profile<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important that you capture the attention of recruiters and employers within the first few seconds of them opening your CV. Failure to do so can result in your CV being skipped over very quickly and forgotten about.<\/p>\n<p>Head your CV up with a short profile that summarises your offerings and persuades readers that you are a strong candidate for your target roles. Your profile should detail your level of education and describe all of the relevant skills and knowledge you have in relation to the roles you are applying for. For best results, tailor your CV heavily to match the essential candidate requirements from your earlier research.<\/p>\n<br><br><br>\n<span>Andrew Fennell is founder of CV writing service<a href=\"https://standout-cv.com\" target=\"_blank\"> StandOut CV <\/a> and author of <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/pages/how-to-write-a-cv\" target=\"_blank\">How to write a CV<\/a> \u2013 the ultimate guide.<\/span>\n<br><br><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jul/13/how-to-write-cv-no-work-experience-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n"

Making a few alterations before every application may take a bit more time, but it will greatly strengthen your chances of landing an interview. Ultimately, it\u2019s better to make one carefully planned application, than make 10 untargeted ones.<\/p>\n<h2>Start with a flexible structure<\/h2>\n<p>To make CV tailoring quick and easy, you need to start with an adaptable base CV to work from. This will serve as a CV that is good enough to apply for most jobs in your field, but can be adjusted in a few minutes when needed.<\/p>\n<p> that highlights the essential skills and knowledge across your niche.  A powerful feature for tailoring (and CV best practice in general) is a \u201ccore skills\u201d section. This is an area of short bullet points listing your most valuable skills, which sit underneath your CV profile. Not only do they provide a great instant snapshot of your talents to readers, they are also easily changeable, allowing you to make effective edits in seconds.<\/p>\n<h2>Study every advert\u2019s requirements<\/h2>\n<p>Read every job advert before you apply and check for the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requirements that you possess, but haven\u2019t included in your CV<\/li>\n<li>Requirements that you possess but that perhaps you aren\u2019t making visible in your CV<\/li>\n<li>Unusual or out-of-the-ordinary requirements that aren\u2019t often required in your niche<\/li>\n<li>Essential requirements that the employer seems to value over all else<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you understand what your CV is lacking for each role, you can begin to tailor it accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>Show relevant skills<\/h2>\n<p>If you boast an attractive skill for a certain employer, don\u2019t hide it at the bottom of your CV.<\/p>\n<p>For example, many people gain degrees and end up working in a completely different field from their studied subject. They then progress through the career ladder, and understandably do not shout about their degree on their CV because it no longer holds much relevance.<\/p>\n<p>However, some employers really value education and make a big point of preferring to hire staff with degrees (no matter how long ago they were achieved). If a candidate finds themselves in a position where they are applying to an employer like this, then their old seemingly-irrelevant degree will suddenly become much more valuable on this occasion.<\/p>\n<h2>Add the important, cut the irrelevant<\/h2>\n<p>If a recruiter doesn\u2019t see the qualities they need on your CV, they probably won\u2019t call you. If a job advert is asking for skills that you possess but haven\u2019t included in the CV, then you need to add them. Similarly, if a requirement seems crucial to a role and you have only touched upon it, you should expand upon it to show off your expertise.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t cut too much<\/h2>\n<p>Try not remove:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entire roles: Especially if they cover long periods of time as you will create unnecessary gaps in your CV. You may get away with removing a totally irrelevant role if it only lasted a month or two, but any longer and you should just shorten it.<\/li>\n<li>Core industry skills: When trying to create space for unusual requirements, don\u2019t sacrifice the essential skills for your roles. Even if you feel those skills are implied due to your work history, a recruiter may not necessarily feel the same way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br><br><br>\n<span>Andrew Fennell is founder of CV writing service<a href=\"https://standout-cv.com\" target=\"_blank\"> StandOut CV <\/a> and author of <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/pages/how-to-write-a-cv\" target=\"_blank\">How to write a CV<\/a> \u2013 the ultimate guide.<\/span>\n<br><br><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jul/13/how-to-write-cv-no-work-experience-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n",

        "text": "<h2>Learning to relax is the best body language tip<\/h2>\n<p>Psychologist Dr Gary Wood recommends forgetting about body language techniques during a job interview. \u201cBody language takes care of itself when we are relaxed,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>But making yourself relaxed isn\u2019t easy. \u201cMost people can overcome interview nerves by adopting some simple breathing and mindfulness techniques before and during the interview,\u201d adds Lisa LaRue, career coach at CareerWorx. One tip is to go into a quiet room and practice slow, deep breathing before you go in. When we are anxious, blood flows away from our brains, so this technique will bring the oxygen back to your head and help you to think clearly.<\/p>\n<h2>Pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses<\/h2>\n<p>Before you have the interview, you need to be self-aware about your skills and weaknesses, says Claire Jenkins, founder of 121 Interview Coaching. \u201cReally step inside the job description and the key words and phrases it contains to work out where you have more or less what they might want,\u201d she says. It\u2019s then a case of using this knowledge to convince your audience that you are the best candidate for the job.<\/p>\n<p>Sarah Archer, co-founder of CareerTree, agrees that you need to think about what makes you stand out against other candidates. \u201cThink about your unique selling points in relation to the role you are being interviewed for and communicate them clearly to the interview panel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Archer adds that knowing your weaknesses is also a strength. \u201cWhen you get asked about your weaknesses, employers are really testing your self awareness,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to hear what you think your development needs are. My best advice to clients for this is whatever weakness you choose to share, have a strategy to manage it.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>So if you say, \u201cI sometimes take on too much\u201d, as a weakness then follow it up with an explanation of the way you manage that weakness. For example: \u201cNow I have a detailed work plan so I can see how much spare capacity I have to take on extra work, and I\u2019ve undertaken assertiveness training.\u201d <\/p>\n<h2>Do a mock interview beforehand<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s well-known that preparation is key for pulling off a strong interview, but Katherine Burik, founder of The Interview Doctor, recommends preparing your responses in writing in advance. \u201cEdit and then practice saying your stories out loud until the responses sound succinct and support your claims. Know by heart the stories you want to tell that demonstrate your accomplishments.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Interview specialist Jon Gregory adds that running mock interviews with a willing friend or family member can also help you hone your technique. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve prepared your answers to common questions, rehearse them thoroughly. This will greatly help with nerves also, if you suffer from them.\u201d <\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t give generic answers<\/h2>\n<p> \u201cThe more specific and tangible examples you can provide that demonstrate that you have the experience needed, the better,\u201d explains interview coach Margaret Buj. \u201cIn my experience most people unfortunately give very generic answers that don\u2019t make them stand out from others.\u201d A good way to stop yourself sounding generic is to provide as many specific examples as you can of how you\u2019ve added value, of course making sure they\u2019re relevant to the skills the interviewers are looking for. <\/p>\n<p>Victoria McLean, founder of CityCV.co.uk, agrees that a common mistake is to give basic answers. \u201cThe internet is a great empowerer, but it also means that we all have access to pretty much the same information.\u201d The way to get ahead of the competition is to apply the knowledge you\u2019ve learned to the wider industry you\u2019re hoping to work in. \u201cAnyone can learn facts about a company but not everyone can give the facts some context by showing an opinion or argument that draws upon the information they\u2019ve learned,\u201d explains McLean. <\/p>\n<br><br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jul/13/how-to-write-cv-no-work-experience-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n",

        "text": "<p>Your CV is your ticket to interviews and job offers, so it needs to be immaculate from start to finish. It only takes one mistake for a recruiter to start doubting your credibility, so you must ensure that your CV is error-free. Here are the most common mistakes recruiters see, and how to fix them: <\/p>\n\n<h2>Not doing your research<\/h2>\n<p>One of the worst mistakes you can make with your CV occurs before you start writing it, and it is: forgetting to do your research. Without researching the needs of your target employers, you will be basing the content on what you think should be on your CV. If you don\u2019t understand what your potential employers want to see in a candidate, you will be simply be using guesswork to write your CV, and setting yourself up to fail.<\/p>\n<p>Before you write a single word, browse through plenty of relevant adverts and compile a list of the most in-demand candidate requirements. Then you will know exactly what skills and knowledge will grab the attention of busy recruiters. <\/p>\n<h2>Poorly-structured job descriptions<\/h2>\n<p>Your recent roles will be heavily scrutinised by recruiters, so it pays off to make them easy to read and understandable. A role that is presented as one huge chunk of text, with no logical structure, is unlikely to impress readers or describe your work properly. <\/p>\n<p>Start your roles with a brief intro that describes the company you work for, where you sit within the hierarchy and what the overall goal of your role is. Then bullet point your responsibilities to show the work you carry out and showcase your skills and output. Finish your role off by highlighting some impressive achievements you have made during your time in the position. <\/p>\n<h2>Not showing your impact<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to show the work you carry out, but it\u2019s even more powerful to show the impact your work has on your employers. Without highlighting the results you have achieved in your previous roles, you are missing a big opportunity to prove the value you can offer an employer. <\/p>\n<p>For example, a sales candidate may list skills such \u201crelationship building, cold calling and networking\u201d but without results, those actions are pointless. They should elaborate to explain that these activities \u201chave led to growth in clients, sales and profits\u201d for their employer. By using results to prove your impact, you will give hiring managers tangible reasons to hire you. <\/p>\n<h2>Generic cliches<\/h2>\n<p> \u201cHard-working team player.\u201d \u201cInnovative forward thinker.\u201d \u201cGo-getting people person.\u201d These types of cliched terms may sound impressive, but they are damaging to your CV. The problem with cliched phrases is that they are hugely overused and they don\u2019t tell readers anything about you. <\/p>\n<p>If you want recruiters to know that you are a hard-working team player, then prove it by using examples of the results you have achieved in team settings. This method will add more context to your message and give readers a much better understanding of your work. <\/p>\n<h2>Too much information<\/h2>\n<p>Recruiters read scores of CVs every day and work to tight deadlines, so they are often pushed for time. If your CV is seven pages long and crammed with every detail of your career, it will not be appealing to read. <\/p>\n<p>Limit your CV to two pages in length and only include information that is relevant to the jobs you are applying for. If your CV is coming in too long, check each point and ask yourself: \u201cWill this persuade a hiring manager to interview me?\u201d If the answer is no, then remove or reduce that point. <\/p>\n<br><br><br>\n<span>Andrew Fennell is founder of CV writing service<a href=\"https://standout-cv.com\" target=\"_blank\"> StandOut CV <\/a> and author of <a href=\"https://standout-cv.com/pages/how-to-write-a-cv\" target=\"_blank\">How to write a CV<\/a> \u2013 the ultimate guide.<\/span>\n<br><br><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jul/13/how-to-write-cv-no-work-experience-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n",

        "text": "<p>Are you stuck on the interview treadmill, going to interviews but not getting any offers? It\u2019s frustrating, especially when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing wrong. <\/p>\n<p>The problem could lie with your interview technique. It can be hard to analyse your own performance in an interview, and it\u2019s rare to get feedback. You might not realise you\u2019ve developed some bad habits that set your interviewers\u2019 teeth on edge, stopping you getting that important job offer. <\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t panic: there are some easy fixes that can get you back on track. Here are some of the common mistakes and what you can do to improve: <\/p>\n<h2>Practicing your answers too much<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone knows preparation is key to interview success. Practicing your answers, especially for competency-based interviews is one of the cornerstones of preparation. <\/p>\n<p>While some candidates learn their answers off by heart, there is nothing more frustrating to an interviewer someone rolling out a rehearsed reply. This can also hinder your ability to reply effectively to questions. <\/p> \n<p>If you over-rehearse, then take your preparation down a notch. Collect evidence of the competencies required for the job but think about how to be flexible with your answers. Make sure you listen to the questions so you really understand what the interviewer wants from you. <\/p>\n<h2>Being too honest<\/h2>\n<p>A key piece of interview advice is to be yourself. But interviewers do not want you to pour out your whole life story, share your terrible weaknesses or explain why you hated your last boss. It can be tempting to tell all when you are nervous but that can sound the death knell for your possible success. <\/p>\n<p>If you are guilty of oversharing, then prior to the interview work out what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to talk about. Think of five points about yourself, relevant to the job, that you could share if asked the question: \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>If you are asked about your weaknesses don\u2019t give the interviewer reasons to be concerned about your ability to do the job. Limit your answer to one weakness and provide a coping strategy. <\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be honest about the negative aspects of your current or previous role, you will come across as a potential disruptive influence on the team \u2013 no one likes a moaner. Instead, process your negative feelings in private and let them go. <\/p>\n<h2>Turning up too early<\/h2>\n<p>All the interview advice books and articles tell you to arrive early for your interview but how early is early? <\/p>\n<p>It can be a pain for the interview panel if you arrive more than 15 minutes earlier than your allotted time. They will be running a tight schedule and don\u2019t want to feel under pressure. Also, it\u2019s not good for your nerves to be sitting in the corridor looking at all the other candidates. <\/p>\n<p>If you do arrive really early, go for a walk around or to a café, which also give you a chance to get familiar with the location. <\/p>\n<h2>Not doing the research<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re pushed for time, it can be easy to not research the company and role thoroughly. But there is nothing more off-putting than interviewing someone who has made no effort to understand what the role entails. <\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s important to not over-rehearse to the point of being a rigid interviewee, do not fall into the trap of going in underprepared. Make sure you know what the company\u2019s vision and strategy is and how your role contributes to it. Consider how your experience relates to this and prepare some strategic questions to ask. <\/p>\n<p>Make sure you also research your potential boss, which will help you find ways to connect with them more effectively during the interview.<\/p>\n<br><br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jul/13/how-to-write-cv-no-work-experience-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Courtesy of Guardian News & Media Ltd<\/a>\n",
